# LibraryManagementSystem
A Library Management System (LMS) using Servlets, JSP, SQL, HTML, and JavaScript allows CRUD operations for managing books and users. Admins and librarians can add, update, delete, and view books. The system uses Servlets for business logic and JSP for dynamic content, with SQL to interact with the database.
